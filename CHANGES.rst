Changelog
=========

2.1.0 (upcoming)
----------------

Supported Python versions are 3.9-3.12.

Enhancements

- ``hod.prepare_sim``: detect and report when a ``prepare_slab`` subprocess fails [#151]
- ci: add python 3.12 and enhance ``NUMBA_DISABLE_JIT`` support [#153]

2.0.1 (2024-03-01)
------------------
This is a bugfix release primarily to add support for ASDF 3.1.0.
Several other bugs in the ZCV and HOD modules are also fixed.

Fixes
~~~~~
- Fix ASDF error in ZCV module, add ASDF 3.1.0 support [#130]
- bug fix keys() [#126]
- Sandydev: fixed reseeding bug [#127]
- fix reseed bug [#128]

- hod tutorial: fixed incorrect positional argument in ``run_hod()`` [#160]

2.0.0 (2023-11-15)
------------------

abacusutils 2.0 introduces a power spectrum module based on fast, parallelized TSC
and FFT, including grid interlacing and window compensation, that can output bandpowers,
Legendre multipoles, (k,mu) wedges, and more.

Furthermore, there's a new Zel'dovich Control Variates (ZCV) module, and the HOD module
has many additions, performance improvements, and bug fixes.

The set of default installed dependencies has also been reduced to avoid trouble with
source-only distributions. Use ``pip install abacusutils[all]`` if you need functionality
provided by a non-default dependency.

This is a relatively large release, so the version number has been bumped to 2.0.0, since
there may be associated backwards incompatibilities.

Supported Python versions are 3.8-3.11. Python 3.7 continues to work, although we'll
drop support if/when this is no longer the case.
