abacusutils
===========

abacusutils is a package for reading and manipulating data products from the Abacus N-body project.
In particular, these utilities are intended for use with the `AbacusSummit <https://abacussummit.readthedocs.io>`_
suite of simulations.  We provide multiple interfaces: primarily Python 3, but also C/C++ [coming soon!] and
language-agnostic interfaces like Unix pipes.

abacusutils is hosted in the `abacusorg/abacusutils <https://github.com/abacusorg/abacusutils>`_ GitHub repository.  Please report
bugs and ask questions by opening an issue in that repository.
