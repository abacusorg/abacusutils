abacusutils
===========

abacusutils is a package for reading and manipulating data products from the Abacus *N*-body project.
In particular, these utilities are intended for use with the `AbacusSummit <https://abacussummit.readthedocs.io>`_
suite of simulations.  The package focuses on the Python 3 API, but there is also a language-agnostic Unix pipe
interface to some of the functionality.

abacusutils is hosted in the `abacusorg/abacusutils <https://github.com/abacusorg/abacusutils>`_ GitHub repository.  Please report
bugs and ask questions by opening an issue in that repository.
